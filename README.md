I have completed two projects utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, in which I was involved in the entire software development lifecycle. This included designing use case diagrams, developing the system architecture, and implementing the code. Throughout these projects, I applied core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to ensure modular, maintainable, and scalable solutions.
